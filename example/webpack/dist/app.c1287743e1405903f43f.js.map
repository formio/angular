Like in the former example, you have the\n\t      * choice of binding to the  `value` or `ngValue` property on the select's options.\n\t      * *\n\t      * {@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n\t      * *\n\t      * Note: We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired\n\t      * for selects in Firefox and IE:\n\t      * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1024350\n\t      * https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/4660045/\n\t      * *\n\t      * * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n\t      * *\n\t     */\n\t    var SelectControlValueAccessor = (function () {\n\t        /**\n\t         * @param {?} _renderer\n\t         * @param {?} _elementRef\n\t         */\n\t        function SelectControlValueAccessor(_renderer, _elementRef) {\n\t            this._renderer = _renderer;\n\t            this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n\t            /** @internal */\n\t            this._optionMap = new Map();\n\t            /** @internal */\n\t            this._idCounter = 0;\n\t            this.onChange = function (_) { };\n\t            this.onTouched = function () { };\n\t        }\n\t        /**\n\t         * @param {?} value\n\t         * @return {?}\n\t         */\n\t        SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.writeValue = function (value) {\n\t            this.value = value;\n\t            var /** @type {?} */ valueString = _buildValueString(this._getOptionId(value), value);\n\t            this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'value', valueString);\n\t        };\n\t        /**\n\t         * @param {?} fn\n\t         * @return {?}\n\t         */\n\t        SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnChange = function (fn) {\n\t            var _this = this;\n\t            this.onChange = function (valueString) {\n\t                _this.value = valueString;\n\t                fn(_this._getOptionValue(valueString));\n\t            };\n\t        };\n\t        /**\n\t         * @param {?} fn\n\t         * @return {?}\n\t         */\n\t        SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnTouched = function (fn) { this.onTouched = fn;

You can also\n      * listen to its {@link AbstractControl.statusChanges} event to be notified when the validation\n      * status is re-calculated.\n      * *\n      * **Add new controls**: You can add new controls to the {@link FormArray} dynamically by\n      * calling its {@link FormArray.push} method.\n      * Ex: `this.form.get('cities').push(new FormControl());`\n      * *\n      * ### Example\n      * *\n      * {@example forms/ts/nestedFormArray/nested_form_array_example.ts region='Component'}\n      * *\n      * * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n      * *\n      * * **NgModule**: `ReactiveFormsModule`\n      * *\n     */\n    var FormArrayName = (function (_super) {\n        __extends$12(FormArrayName, _super);\n        /**\n         * @param {?} parent\n         * @param {?} validators\n         * @param {?} asyncValidators\n         */\n        function FormArrayName(parent, validators, asyncValidators) {\n            _super.call(this);\n            this._parent = parent;\n            this._validators = validators;\n            this._asyncValidators = asyncValidators;\n        }\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        FormArrayName.prototype.ngOnInit = function () {\n            this._checkParentType();\n            this.formDirective.addFormArray(this);\n        };\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        FormArrayName.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () {\n            if (this.formDirective) {\n                this.formDirective.removeFormArray(this);\n            }\n        };\n        Object.defineProperty(FormArrayName.prototype, \"control\", {\n            /**\n             * @return {?}\n             */\n            get: function () { return this.formDirective.getFormArray(this); },\n            enumerable: true,\n            configurable: true\n        });\n        Object.defineProperty(FormArrayName.prototype, \"formDirective\", {\n            /**\n             * @return {?}\n             */\n            get: function () {\n                return this._parent ?
