Form.io Angular JSON Form Renderer
==========================
This library serves as a Dynamic JSON Powered Form rendering library for [Angular](https://angular.io). This works by
providing a JSON schema to a ```<formio>``` Angular component, where that form is dynamically rendered within the front
end application. This allows forms to be dynamically built using JSON schemas.

Angular Material
--------------------------
If you are looking for [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) support, then this is within a separate library @ https://github.com/formio/angular-material-formio

Running Demo
--------------------------
To run a demo of the Form.io Angular renderer, please follow these steps.
 
 1. Make sure you have the [Angular CLI](https://angular.io) installed on your machine.
 2. Download the [Angular Demo Application](https://github.com/formio/angular-demo) to your computer.
 3. With your terminal, type ```npm install```
 4. Now type ```ng serve```
 
This will startup an example application where you can see all the features provided by this module.

Using within your application
---------------------------
You can easily render a form within your Angular 4 application by referencing the URL of that form as follows.

```html
<formio src='https://examples.form.io/example'></formio>
```

You can also pass the JSON form directly to the renderer as follows.

```html
<formio [form]='{
    "title": "My Test Form",
    "components": [
        {
            "type": "textfield",
            "input": true,
            "tableView": true,
            "inputType": "text",
            "inputMask": "",
            "label": "First Name",
            "key": "firstName",
            "placeholder": "Enter your first name",
            "prefix": "",
            "suffix": "",
            "multiple": false,
            "defaultValue": "",
            "protected": false,
            "unique": false,
            "persistent": true,
            "validate": {
                "required": true,
                "minLength": 2,
                "maxLength": 10,
                "pattern": "",
                "custom": "",
                "customPrivate": false
            },
            "conditional": {
                "show": "",
                "when": null,
                "eq": ""
            }
        },
        {
            "type": "textfield",
            "input": true,
            "tableView": true,
            "inputType": "text",
            "inputMask": "",
            "label": "Last Name",
            "key": "lastName",
            "placeholder": "Enter your last name",
            "prefix": "",
            "suffix": "",
            "multiple": false,
            "defaultValue": "",
            "protected": false,
            "unique": false,
            "persistent": true,
            "validate": {
                "required": true,
                "minLength": 2,
                "maxLength": 10,
                "pattern": "",
                "custom": "",
                "customPrivate": false
            },
            "conditional": {
                "show": "",
                "when": null,
                "eq": ""
            }
        },
        {
            "input": true,
            "label": "Submit",
            "tableView": false,
            "key": "submit",
            "size": "md",
            "leftIcon": "",
            "rightIcon": "",
            "block": false,
            "action": "submit",
            "disableOnInvalid": true,
            "theme": "primary",
            "type": "button"
        }
    ]
}'></formio>
```

This is a very simple example. This library is capable of building very complex forms which include e-signatures, columns,
panels, field conditionals, validation requirements, and the list goes on and on.

Usage
----------------
To use this library within your project, you will first need to install it as a dependency.

```
npm install --save @formio/angular formiojs

```js
import { FormioModule } from '@formio/angular';
@NgModule({
    imports: [ BrowserModule, CommonModule, FormioModule ],
    declarations: [ AppComponent ],
    bootstrap: [ AppComponent ]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

About Form.io
-----------------
<a href="https://form.io" target="_blank">Form.io</a> is a combined form and data management API platform created for developers who are building "Serverless" form-based applications.  Form.io provides an easy drag-and-drop form builder workflow allowing you to build complex forms for enterprise applications quickly and easily. These forms are then embedded directly into your application with a single line of code that dynamically renders the form (using Angular or React) in your app while at the very same time generating the RESTful API to support those forms. The Form.io platform also offers numerous 3rd-party services that are fully integrated into the form building process allowing you to extend the power and capability of your apps while saving time and effort.

You can use this renderer with Form.io by simply pointing the ```src``` parameter to the URL of the form. For example, the following URL points to the JSON schema of a form built on Form.io.

  https://pjmfogrfqptslvi.form.io/test
  
To render this form, you simply provide that URL to the ```<formio>``` directive like so.

```<formio src="https://pjmfogrfqptslvi.form.io/test"></formio>```

Not only will this render the form, but it will also submit that form to the provided API endpoint.
